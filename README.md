# general-agentic-memory
A general memory system for agents, powered by deep-research


<h5 align="center"> 🎉 If you like our project, please give us a star ⭐ on GitHub for the latest update.</h5>

**General Agentic Memory (GAM)** provides a next-generation memory framework for AI agents, combining long-term retention with dynamic reasoning. Following the Just-in-Time (JIT) principle, it preserves full contextual fidelity offline while performing deep research online to build adaptive, high-utility context. With its dual-agent architecture—Memorizer and Researcher—GAM integrates structured memory with iterative retrieval and reflection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across LoCoMo, HotpotQA, LongBench v2, and LongCodeBench benchmarks.

## ✨Key Features

* 🧠 Just-in-Time (JIT) Memory Optimization
</br> Unlike conventional Ahead-of-Time (AOT) systems, GAM performs intensive Memory Deep Research at runtime, dynamically retrieving and synthesizing high-utility context to meet real-time agent needs.

* 🔍 Dual-Agent Architecture: Memorizer & Researcher
</br> A cooperative framework where the Memorizer constructs structured memory from raw sessions, and the Researcher performs iterative retrieval, reflection, and summarization to deliver precise, adaptive context.

* 🚀 Superior Performance Across Benchmarks
</br> Achieves state-of-the-art results on LoCoMo, HotpotQA, LongBench v2, and LongCodeBench, surpassing prior systems such as A-MEM, Mem0, and MemoryOS in both F1 and BLEU-1 metrics.

* 🧩 Modular & Extensible Design
</br> Built to support flexible plug-ins for memory construction, retrieval strategies, and reasoning tools—facilitating easy integration into multi-agent frameworks or standalone LLM deployments.

* 🌐 Cross-Model Compatibility
</br> Compatible with leading LLMs such as GPT-5, GPT-4o-mini, and Qwen2.5, supporting both cloud-based and local deployments for research or production environments.
