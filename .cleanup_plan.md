# Codebase Cleanup Plan

## Files to Remove

### Test Files (Not needed in production)
- [ ] `backend/test.py`
- [ ] `backend/test_improvements.py`
- [ ] `backend/test_retriever_fix.py`

### Redundant Documentation (Keep only essential)
- [ ] `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` (redundant with IMPROVEMENTS.md)
- [ ] `QUICK_START_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (redundant)
- [ ] `README_CN.md` (Chinese version, keep if needed)

### Migration Scripts (One-time use, can be archived)
- [ ] `backend/migrate_to_hybrid.py` (keep for reference but can be moved to /scripts)

## Files to Clean (Remove excessive comments)

### Backend
- [ ] `backend/api/chat.py` - Remove debug comments
- [ ] `backend/api/documents.py` - Simplify comments
- [ ] `backend/core/gam_manager.py` - Remove verbose comments
- [ ] `backend/utils/graph_builder.py` - Simplify docstrings
- [ ] `backend/storage/chunk_db.py` - Remove redundant comments
- [ ] `backend/storage/db_page_store.py` - Simplify

### GAM Core
- [ ] `gam/agents/research_agent.py` - Remove Chinese comments, simplify
- [ ] `gam/retriever/dense_retriever.py` - Remove Chinese comments

## Keep These Files
- `IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Main documentation
- `RETRIEVAL_UX_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Recent improvements
- `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Recent improvements
- All production code files

## Cleanup Rules
1. Remove all test files
2. Keep only one main documentation file
3. Remove excessive inline comments
4. Keep docstrings but make them concise
5. Remove debug print statements (or make them conditional)
6. Remove commented-out code
7. Remove Chinese comments (translate if important)
